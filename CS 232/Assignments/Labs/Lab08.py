def more_vowels(string1:str, string2:str):
    '''
    Expects two strings and determines which one
    has the most vowels.

    Expects:
        string1 - First string
        string2 - Second string

    Returns:
        An int value:
            1 - string1 has more vowels
            2 - string2 has more vowels
            0 - both have equal amount of vowels

    Side-effects:
        Prints a message, depending on the result:
            "The first string has more vowels"
            "The second string has more vowels"
            "The strings have an equal number of vowels"
