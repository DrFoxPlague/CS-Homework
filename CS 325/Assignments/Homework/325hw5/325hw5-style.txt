Problem 1
=========

1a. An ORDER BY clause can only be used for an outermost SELECT statement
    and must be indented to where it's clear that it belongs to that
    select statement.

1b. A GROUP BY clause can only be used when one has a good reason, like
    1+ aggregate functions used.

1c. Nested select statments must be within parentheses.

1d. When it comes to EXISTS and NOT EXISTS, you will need an appropriate
    correlation condition and to project a literal in its sub-select
    argument
